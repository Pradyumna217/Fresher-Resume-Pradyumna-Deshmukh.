            <h3>Project Description</h3>
            <p>A small scale thermal power plant converts heat
                energy to steam. Here the water is heated till it turns to superheated steam
                which is used to rotate the turbine where the mechanical energy is
                generated. The turbine is further connected to the generator which
                converts mechanical energy of the turbine to electricity.
